      In 1966, three years before the ARPAnet delivered its first packet [1]
      and two years before engelbart's mother of all demos [2],
      a father/daughter duo [3] published a history of the internet in a Swedish sci-fi novel.

      Tale of the Big Computer was first translated, published, and widely panned in 1968 [4].
      It has built a small following over the last 50-odd years for its uncanny prescience;
      the authors describe in vivid detail not just how we interface with a global system of interconnected computers,
      but also how that system acts on us [5].

      We are publishing a new English edition of this Swedish cult classic.
      The original books have become quite rare and expensive [6],
      and the 1968 translation is both unnecessarily and inaccurately gendered [7].
